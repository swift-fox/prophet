A mind reading game. It asks you questions and guesses the person or object you are thinking about. It's extremely magical when you first try it.

It posseses great learning ability. When fails guess what you think, it learns from your answers to ensure correct guessing in the next time. And you can teach it anything or any concept.

The mechanism behind it is the decision tree, a Machine Learning algorithm, which selects possible candidates based on you answers.

The current dataset, which is the range it can guess correctly, includes famous singers, movie stars, great entrepreneurs, major IT companies and computer science professors in University of Utah.

It was inspired by the Q20 mind reading game developed by the Knowledge Mining group of Microsoft Research Asia. And it was designed and written from scratch.
